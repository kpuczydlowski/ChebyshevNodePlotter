# ChebyshevNodePlotter
Matlab plotting script for Chebyshev node distribution

Call fun_plotter script to plot the Runge function to demonstrate equal and Chebysheb node distribution for a polynomial approximation using Newton's interpolation method. Constants for plotting can be changed in the fun_plotter file, and it defaults to 5 plots with random interpolation and sampling points.
